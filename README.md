## Custom Hooks
1. allows us to reuse non-visual logic in multiple components
2. one custom hook should have one purpose, to make it reuseable + portable (even across multiple projects)
3. rules of hooks apply on custom hooks too
4. function name needs to start with use
5. needs to use one or more hooks
6. unlike components, can receive & return any relevant data (usually {} or [])

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the application using `npm start`.
4. Explore the custom hook with react!
